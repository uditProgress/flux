## Walk Workflow

This project follows the **Walk** methodology — a plan-first, evidence-backed approach to every change. Whether you are
fixing a bug, adding a feature, or refactoring, every PR should follow this cycle:

```
Plan → Implement → Verify → Document
```

### 1. Plan before you code

Before writing any code, create a short plan that answers:

- **What** are you changing and **why**?
- **Which files** will be touched (aim for 2–4 per PR)?
- **What evidence** will prove the change works (test output, coverage delta, screenshot)?
- **How do you roll back** if something goes wrong?

Include this plan in your PR description. You can draft it as a checklist, a table, or prose — the format matters less
than having it written down before the first diff.

### 2. Keep PRs small and reviewable

- Target **2–4 files** of meaningful change per PR. If a change touches more, split it.
- Each PR should have a **single clear purpose** (one bug fix, one feature, one refactor).
- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones to avoid file sprawl.

### 3. Branching strategy

| Branch | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `main` | Latest stable release |
| `develop` | Integration branch — CI publishes from here |
| `feature/<short-name>` | New features — branch from `develop`, merge back to `develop` |
| `fix/<short-name>` | Bug fixes — same flow as features |
| `refactor/<short-name>` | Structural improvements with no behavior change |

Always branch from `develop` unless you are targeting a hotfix to `main`.

### 4. PR expectations

Every pull request must include:

1. **A plan** — what, why, which files, expected impact (in the PR description).
2. **Evidence** — test output, coverage summary, or a screenshot proving the change works.
3. **Green CI** — the Jenkins pipeline must pass. If tests cannot run locally (e.g. no Java 17
   toolchain), note that explicitly and rely on CI.
4. **Rollback instructions** — a one-liner (`git revert <sha>`) or explicit steps if the change
   is more involved.

Use the [PR template](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) — it prompts for all of the above.

### 5. Using Copilot with this workflow

Copilot is encouraged at every stage:

| Stage | How to use Copilot |
|-------|-------------------|
| **Plan** | Ask Copilot to list entry points, identify duplication, or propose a refactor scope. |
| **Implement** | Let Copilot generate diffs file-by-file. Review each diff before accepting. |
| **Verify** | Ask Copilot to run tests, check for compilation errors, or validate diagrams. |
| **Document** | Have Copilot draft the PR description, update architecture docs, or generate a coverage summary. |

**Ground rule:** Always review Copilot output against the actual codebase. Copilot may hallucinate file paths or API
signatures — verify before committing.

### 6. Evidence checklist

Before marking a PR ready for review, confirm:

- [ ] Plan is written in the PR description
- [ ] Tests pass (`./gradlew clean test`)
- [ ] Coverage summary included (`bash scripts/print-coverage-summary.sh`)
- [ ] Contract tests pass if CLI commands or API methods changed
- [ ] Architecture diagram validated if docs changed (`bash scripts/validate-mermaid.sh`)
- [ ] No new compiler warnings (`-Xlint:unchecked -Xlint:deprecation` are enforced)
- [ ] Rollback path documented

### 7. Contract tests

The `ContractTest` class validates two boundaries against golden files:

| Boundary | Golden file | What it checks |
|----------|------------|----------------|
| CLI command registry | `flux-cli/src/test/resources/contract/cli-commands.txt` | Every subcommand name registered in `Main.java` |
| Public API surface | `flux-cli/src/test/resources/contract/api-methods.txt` | Every static factory method on `Flux.java` |

If you add or remove a CLI command or API method, `ContractTest` will fail. To fix:

1. Run the test — the failure message shows the expected vs. actual list.
2. Edit the corresponding golden file (one entry per line, sorted alphabetically).
3. Re-run and confirm green.

## Development Environment Setup

After completing the Docker and Gradle setup above, run the following to pull a small model for the test instance of
Ollama to use; this will be used by one or more embedder tests:

    docker exec -it docker-tests-flux-ollama-1 ollama pull all-minilm

Some of the tests depend on the Postgres instance deployed via Docker. Follow these steps to load a sample dataset
into it:

1. Go to [this Postgres tutorial](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-getting-started/postgresql-sample-database/).
2. Scroll down to the section titled "Download the PostgreSQL sample database". Follow the instructions there for 
downloading the `dvdrental.zip` and extracting it to produce a file named `dvdrental.tar` (one option is to use Java - 
`jar -xvf dvdrental.zip`).
3. Copy `dvdrental.tar` to `./docker/postgres/dvdrental.tar` in this project.

Once you have the `dvdrental.tar` file in place, run these commands to load it into Postgres:

```
docker exec -it docker-tests-flux-postgres-1 psql -U postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE dvdrental"
docker exec -it docker-tests-flux-postgres-1 pg_restore -U postgres -d dvdrental /opt/dvdrental.tar
```

The Docker file includes a pgadmin instance which can be accessed at <http://localhost:5480/>. 
If you wish to login to this, do so with "postgres@pgadmin.com" and 
a password of "postgres". For logging into Postgres itself, use "postgres" as the username and password. You can then
register a server that connects to the "postgres" server.

## Building the distribution locally

If you would like to test our the Flux distribution - as either a tar or zip - perform the following steps:

1. Run either `./gradlew distTar` or `./gradlew distZip`.
2. Move the file created at `./flux-cli/build/distributions` to a desired location.
3. Extract the file. 
4. `cd` into the extracted directory.

You can now run `./bin/flux` to test out various commands. 

If you're testing with the project at `./examples/getting-started`, you can run the following to install Flux in that 
directory, thus allowing you to test out the examples in that project:

    ./gradlew buildToolForGettingStarted

If you wish to build the Flux zip with all the embedding model integration JARs included, you must first run the 
`copyEmbeddingModelJarsIntoDistribution` task. That name is intentionally verbose, but it's a lot to type, so take
advantage of Gradle's ability to extrapolate task names:

    ./gradlew copyemb distZip

You can also do the following include the integration JARs in the Flux installation in the `examples/getting-started` 
project (again taking advantage of Gradle's ability to extrapolate task names):

    ./gradlew copyemb buildtoolfor

## Configuring the version

You can specify a version for Flux when building Flux via any of the following:

    ./gradlew distTar -Pversion=changeme
    ./gradlew distZip -Pversion=changeme
    ./gradlew installDist -Pversion=changeme

The version can then be viewed by running `./bin/flux version`. 

## Running the tests

You can run the tests once you've followed the instructions above for loading the DVD rental dataset into Postgres and
publishing a local snapshot of our Spark connector. Then just run:

    ./gradlew clean test

If you are running the tests in Intellij, you will need to perform the following steps:

1. Go to Run -> Edit Configurations in the Intellij toolbar.
2. Click on "Edit configuration templates".
3. Select "JUnit". 
4. In the text box containing JVM arguments, add the text below:

```
--add-opens java.base/sun.nio.ch=ALL-UNNAMED 
--add-opens java.base/sun.util.calendar=ALL-UNNAMED 
--add-opens java.base/java.io=ALL-UNNAMED 
--add-opens java.base/sun.nio.cs=ALL-UNNAMED
--add-opens java.base/sun.security.action=ALL-UNNAMED
```

When you run one or more tests, the above configuration template settings will be used, allowing all Flux tests to 
pass on Java 17. If you are running a test configuration that you ran prior to making the changes, you will need to 
delete that configuration first via the "Run -> Edit Configurations" panel.

If you are running tests in Intellij via Intellij and not via the Gradle wrapper, you will also need to run 
`./gradlew shadowJar` first to ensure a couple shadow jars are created that are required by some of the `flux-cli` 
tests. You do not need to do this if you have Intellij configured to use Gradle to run tests in Intellij.

## Generating code quality reports with SonarQube

Please see our internal Wiki page - search for "Developer Experience SonarQube" -
for information on setting up SonarQube and using it with this repository.

You can run `./gradlew clean testCodeCoverageReport` to run the tests and generate code coverage data. The output will
be written to `code-coverage-report/build`. Unfortunately though, Sonarqube does not appear to consume this data 
correctly. For example, as of 2025-04-23, the Jacoco test report will show 84% coverage but Sonarqube will only report 
76% coverage.

## Running code coverage locally

The project uses **JaCoCo** for code coverage, aggregated across all modules by the `code-coverage-report` subproject.

### Quick start

```bash
# Run all tests and produce the aggregate JaCoCo report
./gradlew clean testCodeCoverageReport
```

### Output locations

| Artifact | Path |
|----------|------|
| Aggregate XML report | `code-coverage-report/build/reports/jacoco/testCodeCoverageReport/testCodeCoverageReport.xml` |
| Aggregate HTML report | `code-coverage-report/build/reports/jacoco/testCodeCoverageReport/html/index.html` |
| flux-cli module XML | `flux-cli/build/reports/jacoco/test/jacocoTestReport.xml` |

### Printing a coverage summary

After generating the report you can print a quick summary to the terminal:

```bash
bash scripts/print-coverage-summary.sh
```

This parses the aggregate XML and prints instruction, branch, line, method, and class coverage percentages.
Include the output in your PR description (see `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` for the template).

### How it works

1. The `flux-cli` module applies the `jacoco` plugin and its `test` task is finalized by `jacocoTestReport` (see `flux-cli/build.gradle`).
2. The `code-coverage-report` module applies the `jacoco-report-aggregation` plugin and depends on all testable modules (see `code-coverage-report/build.gradle`).
3. Running `testCodeCoverageReport` executes tests in every module and merges their execution data into a single report.
4. SonarQube reads the aggregate XML via the `sonar.coverage.jacoco.xmlReportPaths` property in the root `build.gradle`.

### CI coverage

The Jenkins pipeline already runs `testCodeCoverageReport` in the **tests** stage (see `Jenkinsfile`), so coverage data is produced on every build.

## Testing the documentation locally

The docs for this project are stored in the `./docs` directory as a set of Markdown files. These are published via
[GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages) using the
configuration found under "Settings / Pages" in this repository.

You can build and test the docs locally by
[following these GitHub instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll),
though you don't need to perform all of those steps since some of the files generated by doing so are already in the
`./docs` directory. You just need to do the following:

1. Install the latest Ruby 3.x (rbenv works well for this).
2. Install Jekyll.
3. Go to the docs directory - `cd ./docs` .
4. Run `bundle install` (this may not be necessary due to Gemfile.lock being in version control).
5. Run `bundle exec jekyll serve`.

You can then go to http://localhost:4000 to view the docs. 

## Updating the published Javadoc

This project's Javadocs are being published via inclusion in the `docs/assets/javadoc` directory. To update these
files after changing any of the classes in the `com.marklogic.flux.api` package, run the following:

    ./gradlew updateJavadoc

## Testing with a load balancer

The `docker-compose.yml` file includes an instance of a 
[Caddy load balancer](https://caddyserver.com/docs/caddyfile/directives/reverse_proxy). This is useful for any kind 
of performance testing, as you typically want Flux (and our Spark connector) to connect to a load balancer that can 
both distribute load and handle retrying failed connections. 

The `./caddy/config/Caddyfile` configuration file has some default config in it for communicating with a 3-node cluster
owned by the performance team. Feel free to adjust this config locally as needed. 

Example of using the existing config to copy from port 8015 to port 8016 in the performance cluster:

```
./flux/bin/flux copy --connection-string "admin:admin@localhost:8006" \
  --collections "address_small" \
  --batch-size 500 \
  --limit 10000 \
  --categories content,metadata \
  --output-connection-string "admin:admin@localhost:8007" \
  --output-thread-count 3 --partitions-per-forest 1 --output-batch-size 200
```

## Upgrading dependencies

When upgrading a dependency, follow this process:

1. **Check availability** — verify the new version resolves:
   ```
   ./gradlew :flux-cli:dependencies --configuration runtimeClasspath | grep <dependency>
   ```

2. **Apply the upgrade** — edit the version in `gradle.properties` (for shared versions) or
   `flux-cli/build.gradle` (for direct references).

3. **Verify resolution** — ensure no `FAILED` entries:
   ```
   ./gradlew :flux-cli:dependencies --configuration runtimeClasspath | grep FAILED
   ```

4. **Run the test suite** — `./gradlew clean test`.

5. **Update NOTICE.txt** — update version numbers in the dependency table, license listing,
   and NOTICE text sections.

6. **Update constraint comments** — if any `build.gradle` constraint references the old
   version in its `because` string, update it.

7. **Document rollback** — include the rollback command in the commit/PR (e.g.,
   `sed -i 's/tikaVersion=3.3.0/tikaVersion=3.2.3/' gradle.properties`).

### Key version properties in `gradle.properties`

| Property | Current | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| `picocliVersion` | 4.7.7 | CLI framework (30+ files) |
| `sparkVersion` | 4.1.1 | Core data engine — **high risk** |
| `hadoopVersion` | 3.4.2 | Aligned with Spark — **high risk** |
| `awssdkVersion` | 2.29.52 | Aligned with Hadoop — **medium risk** |
| `langchain4jVersion` | 1.11.0 | Embedding modules |
| `tikaVersion` | 3.3.0 | Document parsing (no direct API usage) |

## Testing against a separate Spark cluster

This section describes how to test the ETL tool against a separate Spark cluster instead of having the tool stand up
its own temporary Spark environment.

To begin, install Spark via [sdkman](https://sdkman.io/sdks#spark), unless you already have a Spark cluster ready.
Verify that ports 8080 and 7077 are available as well, as Spark will attempt to listen on both.

Set `SPARK_HOME` to the location of Spark - e.g. `/Users/myname/.sdkman/candidates/spark/current`.

Next, start a Spark master node:

    cd $SPARK_HOME/sbin
    start-master.sh

You will need the address at which the Spark master node can be reached. To find it, open the log file that Spark
created under `$SPARK_HOME/logs` - it will have the word "master" in its filename - and look for text like the following
near the end of the log file:

    INFO Master: Starting Spark master at spark://NYWHYC3G0W:7077

Now start a Spark worker node by referencing that address:

    start-worker.sh spark://NYWHYC3G0W:7077

To verify that Spark is running correctly, go to <http://localhost:8080>. You should see the Spark Master web interface,
along with a link to the worker that you started. You are now able to run tests against this Spark cluster.

### Testing with spark-submit

Spark's [spark-submit](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html) program allows for a Spark
program to be run on a separate (and possibly remote) Spark cluster. Now that you have a separate Spark cluster running
per the above instructions, you can test each CLI command by running it via spark-submit.

First, you must build an assembly jar that contains the required CLI functionality in a single jar file (this uses
the [Gradle shadow jar plugin](https://imperceptiblethoughts.com/shadow/); "assembly jar", "shadow jar", and "uber jar"
are all synonyms):

    ./gradlew shadowJar

This will produce an assembly jar at `./flux-cli/build/libs/marklogic-flux-2.1-SNAPSHOT-all.jar`.

You can now run any CLI command via spark-submit. This is an example of previewing an import of files - change the value
of `--path`, as an absolute path is needed, and of course change the value of `--master` to match that of your Spark
cluster:

```
$SPARK_HOME/bin/spark-submit --class com.marklogic.flux.spark.Submit \
--master spark://NYWHYC3G0W:7077 flux-cli/build/libs/marklogic-flux-2.1-SNAPSHOT-all.jar \
import-files --path /Users/rudin/workspace/flux/flux-cli/src/test/resources/mixed-files \
--connection-string "admin:admin@localhost:8000" \
--preview 5 --preview-drop content
```

After spark-submit completes, you can refresh <http://localhost:8080> to see evidence of the completed application.

The assembly jar does not include the AWS SDK, as doing so would increase its size from about 8mb to close to 400mb.
spark-submit allows for dependencies to be included via its `--packages` option. The following shows an example of
previewing an import of files from an S3 bucket by including the AWS SDK as package dependencies (change the bucket name
to something you can access):

```
$SPARK_HOME/bin/spark-submit --class com.marklogic.flux.spark.Submit \
--packages org.apache.hadoop:hadoop-aws:3.3.4,org.apache.hadoop:hadoop-client:3.3.4 \
--master spark://NYWHYC3G0W:7077 \
flux-cli/build/libs/marklogic-flux-2.1-SNAPSHOT-all.jar \
import-files --path "s3a://changeme/" \
--connection-string "admin:admin@localhost:8000" \
--s3-add-credentials \
--preview 10 --preview-drop content
```

### Testing with AWS EMR

[AWS EMR](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/) supports running spark-submit in AWS.

This is not intended to be a reference on how to use EMR. Instead, the following are recommended while creating a
cluster:

1. Before creating a cluster, build the assembly jar as described above and upload it to an S3 bucket in the same
   AWS region as where you'll be creating an EMR cluster.
2. In the "Create a cluster" form, keep "Publish cluster-specific logs to Amazon S3" checked, as otherwise you won't
   have access to logs written by your EMR step.
3. In the "IAM Roles" section while creating a cluster, it is recommended to create a new EMR service role and
   a new EC2 instance profile for EMR.
4. For the EC2 instance profile, ensure that it has access to any S3 buckets you will be using, including the bucket
   that you uploaded the assembly jar to.

Once your cluster is created, you'll add a "Step" in order to run spark-submit:

1. Choose "Spark application" for the type of job.
2. For "JAR location", select the assembly jar that you uploaded to S3.
3. For "Spark-submit options", enter `--class com.marklogic.flux.spark.Submit`.
4. For "Arguments", enter the CLI command all the args you would normally enter when using the CLI.

If your CLI command will be accessing S3, you most likely should not include `--s3-add-credentials`. The EMR EC2 instance
will already have access to the S3 buckets per the "EC2 instance profile" you configured while creating your cluster.

Additionally, if your CLI command is accessing an S3 bucket in a region other than the one that EMR is running in,
you can add `--s3-endpoint s3.us-east-1.amazon.com` as an argument, replacing "us-east-1" with the region that the
S3 buckets is in.

After adding your step, it will run. It typically takes about 30s for the step to run, and it may take a minute or so
for links to the logs to show up. It is very easy for a step to fail due to a security issue with accessing an S3
bucket, whether it's the bucket containing the assembly jar or an S3 path in your CLI command. You may want to
temporarily make the buckets you're accessing open to the public for reading.
